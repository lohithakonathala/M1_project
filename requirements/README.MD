# INTRODUCTION

The following is an example game written in C based on the game called 'snake' 

which has been around since the earliest days of home computing (1 can remember writing a version of it for my ZX81), and has re-emerged in recent years on mobile phones.

It isn't the world's greatest game, but it does give you an idea of what you can achieve with a relatively simple C program, and perhaps the basis by which to extend the principles and create more interesting games of your own.
